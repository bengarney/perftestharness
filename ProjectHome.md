### Every coder knows that certain techniques are supposed to be faster than others. But no one has hard numbers. ###

The **Performance Test Harness** is a framework for automated performance comparisons, along with a suite of code fragments implementing common techniques. Some are compute-only tests, for instance measuring the speed difference of traversing an array randomly or linearly. Others are graphics-oriented tests, for instance measuring the change in fill rate due to different AA schemes.

_By giving programmers hard data to guide their intuition, we hope to remove the "voodoo" from fast code and give visibility into this murky aspect of programming._
