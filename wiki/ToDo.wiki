This page is a temporary holding spot for brainstorming.  This will probaby need to be organized better some day soon.


= Tasks =

Harness Work
  * Build a system into the test harness that allows us to save out all data points not just stats like min, max, and mean.

Utility Development

  * Fullscreen quad draw
  * Vertex Limiter
  * Pixel Shader Limiter
  * Texture Limiter
  * XML utility: So that the xml output is better encapsulated

GPU Tests
  * Vertex Buffer Size
  * Vertex Alignment
  * Overdraw performance

CPU Tests
  * CPU Stream Count
  * float vs. double performance
  * integer vs. long performance
  * integer vs. float performance
  * float vs. double performance
  * random vs. linear memory access vs. strided access
  * single vs. multi-thread linear access
  * single vs. multi-thread random access
